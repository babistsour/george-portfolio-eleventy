I'm a pure 90s baby. I'm proud to say so. For those that came before, you might say your formative decade was the best. For those that came after, I feel sorry for you. The economy was booming, The music was amazing, The 90s had some of the best shows, The fashion was hip, Technology didnâ€™t control us, Life was simpler and free!
