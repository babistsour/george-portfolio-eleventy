Every March, Trikala Running Club, organizes the Road Race 21K Challenge Kalampaka-Trikala, Thanassis Stamopoulos. The route starts from the town of Kalampaka. 

So the organization trusted me to create a poster which will held the whole campaign.

Thank you so much for being part of it. And i will run, also ;-)
