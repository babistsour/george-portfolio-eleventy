Here is a new packaging rebranding for the coffee shop AK based in Trikala, Greece. Andreas and Maria, the owners of the Cafe wanted to make a design for their cups based on minimal style and pop colors. So i "played" with pink, red and blue, an interesting color blocking. The minimal perspective of this design came by the idea of using geometrical shapes and abstract style. Thanks to our great corporation i came to that resurt. If you visit Trikala, my hometown, pay a visit to that Coffee shop and taste the great coffee that they serve!!
