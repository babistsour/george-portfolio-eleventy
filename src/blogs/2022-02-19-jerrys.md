Thanasis and Vangelis are two friends from school who love the original greek street food. They decided to start their own Street food shop where you can experience greek tastes. They trusted me to make their logo giving me my own creative space of making something unique. So i designed this logo by using an american style but making something urban and "streety". Thanks guys for our great corporation.
