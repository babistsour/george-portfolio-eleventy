# The restaurant Zorbas is based in Germany. The owner approached me on the creative offfice that i work URBAN. We discussed about rebranding. He used to have a logo but he wanted a new one. I asked him to show me the restaurant and after a long conversation i realised what he wants to see for a new logo. Thats also the big deal for a graphic designer. Making understand what the client wants. So i designed a logo with vintage lines but todays minimal construction. I wanted to make a connection the past of this heavy name "zorbas" with the present and of course the future. I was excited of this history travel that this job offered me.
