Domus cafe bar is a project that i started to work from scratch. DImitra and her husband Vasilis started to make their on cafeteria in an urban location of Trikala. Fistly, we made a conversation about how they imaginated their logo. They asked me to create a vintage logo with minimal style and earthly colors. As they said, "we want sth that will make someone feels like home". So i made it ;-).

Then i designed the Domus take away cups based on the main concept / idea of the logo.\
If you taste their coffee, you certainly feel like you made it on your own home. Intersting project for interested people!
