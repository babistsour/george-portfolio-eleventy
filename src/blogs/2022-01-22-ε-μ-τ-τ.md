description: "One of my latest designs. Giorgos Vagiatas, an well known greek
  youtuber, trusted me to make his logo for his travel show. A show that travels
  around the world with a caravan Giorgos and his friends: Alex his co partner
  and friend, Pasxalis his childhood friend  and his brother Dimitris show us
  the world with their own perspective of it. Funny, unexpected, grunge and very
  interesting point of how to spend our moments when we travel. Thank so mush
  for being part of it!"
