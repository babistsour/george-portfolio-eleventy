Zeblo Cafe is a coffee shop / take away located to Athens, Greece. When Orestis, the owner of the shop, approeched me, he wanted to make sth that it will make people wonder and be part of the coffee experience. Me and my co partner Thanasis decided to create an idea with first role the animal zebra (chosen by Orestis). Making different kind of draft logos, we made our decision and show on the surface this logo. For our surprise, Orestis and costumers loved it with the first sight. I am happy for being part of it. ;-)
